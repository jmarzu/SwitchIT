##Technologies Used
* JQuery
* Sweetalert

## My Approach 
From the beginning my goal was to reduce the hardcoding down to a minimum and set the game up to be scalable by only adding to the monsters array and the 2 levels array. 

I went for a clean look and feel UI-wise, and focused on making a game that can progress and grow with the user. 

Some cool features are:
* Dynamically created gameArray and HTML board
* Multiple Levels
* Ability to add levels and monsters easily and have them referenced in the game


## Installation Instructions
Fork to your own repository and clone to your computer to play with the code.
